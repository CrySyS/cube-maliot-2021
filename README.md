# CUBE-MALIOT-2021

## Repository content

This repository contains information about IoT malware collected between 2021 and 2020.

Information about samples is stored in json files, sorted by architecture into the `arm` and `mips` directories.

`cube-maliot-json.schema` is a json schema we used to validate and document the structure of the json files.

`template.txt` can be used to request access to the binary samples.

## Binary samples

The malware samples can be downloaded from [here](https://cloud.crysys.hu/s/WMKgGqxZsaQPPgf) as an encrypted zip file.

For the password, fill our template & send it to `cube-maliot@crysys.hu`.
